## Three Ways to Improve Semantic Segmentation with Self-Supervised Depth Estimation

This is the official pytorch implementation of our paper 
[Three Ways to Improve Semantic Segmentation with Self-Supervised Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10782.pdf).

Training deep networks for semantic segmentation requires large amounts of labeled training data, which presents a major
challenge in practice, as labeling segmentation masks is a highly labor-intensive process. To address this issue, 
we present a framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which is enhanced by self-supervised monocular depth 
estimation from unlabeled images.

In particular, we propose three key contributions:

1. We transfer knowledge from features learned during self-supervised depth estimation to semantic segmentation. 
2. We implement a strong data augmentation by blending images and labels using the structure of the scene.
3. We utilize the depth feature diversity as well as the level of difficulty of learning depth in a student-teacher 
framework to select the most useful samples to be annotated for semantic segmentation.

We validate the proposed model on the Cityscapes dataset, where all three modules demonstrate significant performance 
gains, and we achieve state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised semantic segmentation.

Below, you can see the qualitative results of our model trained with only 100 annotated semantic segmentation samples.

### Setup Environment

To install all requirements, you can run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

Please download Cityscapes from https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/. We require following packages:
gtFine_trainvaltest.zip, leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip, and leftImg8bit_sequence_trainvaltest.zip. 
For performance reasons, we work on a downsampled copy of Cityscapes. Please refer to 
[data_preprocessing/prepare_cityscapes.py](data_preprocessing/prepare_cityscapes.py) for
more information.

Before continuing, you should have following folder structure prepared:

```
CITYSCAPES_DIR/
- gtFine/
- leftImg8bit_small/
- leftImg8bit_sequence_small/
```

You can setup the paths for data and logging in the machine config ``configs/machine_confg.py``.
In the following, we assume that you have called your machine `ws`.

### Pretrain Self-supervised Depth on Cityscapes

To run the two phases of the pretraining (first 300k iterations with frozen encoder and 50k iterations with ImageNet
feature distance loss), you can execute:

```
python train.py --machine ws --config configs/cityscapes_monodepth_highres_dec5_crop.yml
python train.py --machine ws --config configs/cityscapes_monodepth_highres_dec6_crop.yml
```

For more information on the configuration, see the corresponding yaml files. The trained models are available on
Google Drive. The download information is provided in [models/utils.py](models/utils.py).

### Run Semi-Supervised Experiments

The semi-supervised experiments can be executed using:

```
python run_experiments.py --machine ws --exp EXP_ID
```

The EXP_ID corresponds to the experiment defined in [experiments.py](experiments.py).
Following experiments are relevant for the paper:

* **Experiment 210:** All configurations that are only based on transfer learning.
* **Experiment 211:** Unsupervised data selection for annotation configurations.
* **Experiment 212:** Configurations that involve multi-task learning.

To use the labels selected by the unsupervised data selection for the other experiments, please copy the content of 
`nlabelsXXX_subset.json` from the log directory to [loader/preselected_labels.py](loader/preselected_labels.py).
For better reproducibility, we have stored our results there as well.
Table 3 is generated using experiment 210 with config sel_{pres_method}_scratch. 

Be aware that running all experiments takes multiple weeks on a single GPU. 
For that reason, we have commented out all but one subset size and seed as well as minor ablations.
